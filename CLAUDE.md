# Rules

- **Never hand-edit files under `model/`.** They are auto-generated. Fix the
  codegen pipeline in `codegen/<provider>/` and regenerate instead.
- Only touch what's necessary — don't refactor adjacent code.
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types in hand-written code (generated code
  may use `any`).
- Named exports only, no default exports.
- Pin all npm dependencies to exact versions (no ranges).
- `deno.lock` is committed — run `deno install --frozen` to verify.

## Testing Rules

- Never rely on live cloud services in tests.
- Use local HTTP servers (`Deno.serve({ port: 0 })`) or in-memory mock clients.
- Restore all env vars in a `finally` block.
- Tests that create SDK clients with connection pooling need
  `sanitizeResources: false` with a comment explaining why.
- Use `@systeminit/swamp-testing` conformance helpers
  (`assertVaultExportConformance`, `assertDatastoreExportConformance`, etc.).
- Canonical test example: `vault/aws-sm/extensions/vaults/aws_sm_test.ts`

## Commands

### Vault / Datastore extensions (run from extension directory)

```bash
cd vault/aws-sm  # or datastore/s3, etc.
deno check extensions/<type>/*.ts
deno lint extensions/<type>/
deno fmt extensions/<type>/
deno test <flags> extensions/<type>/
deno install --frozen
```

### Code generation (run from codegen/)

```bash
cd codegen
deno task fetch-schema:aws
deno task fetch-schema:gcp
deno task fetch-schema:hetzner
deno task fetch-schema:digitalocean
deno task generate:aws
deno task generate:gcp
deno task generate:hetzner
deno task generate:digitalocean
```

AWS and GCP support service filtering: `deno task generate:aws ec2 s3 lambda`

```bash
deno task generate:aws-credentials
```

Generates shared AWS credential utilities (IMDS skip, error classification,
preflight check) into hand-written extension directories from the canonical
source at `codegen/shared/awsCredentials.ts`. Generated files are
auto-generated — do not hand-edit.

**Note:** AWS and GCP models live under `model/aws/<service>/` and
`model/gcp/<service>/` (one directory per service, ~249 AWS / ~260 GCP).
Hetzner and DigitalOcean each have a single directory. Each service directory
has its own `deno.json`, `deno.lock`, and `manifest.yaml`.

### Benchmarks (run from datastore/benchmarks/)

```bash
cd datastore/benchmarks
deno task benchmark:s3    # S3 benchmarks against MinIO
deno task benchmark:gcs   # GCS benchmarks against fake-gcs-server
deno task benchmark:compare  # Cross-version comparison (defaults to S3)
```

Requires Docker for emulators, or set `BENCHMARK_S3_ENDPOINT` and
`BENCHMARK_GCS_ENDPOINT` to use pre-running instances.

### Codegen verification (run from codegen/)

```bash
deno check main.ts
deno lint
deno fmt
```

After regenerating, review the diffs in `model/` to confirm only the intended
changes appear. Run generation a second time to verify idempotency — there
should be zero new diffs on the second run.

### Codegen architecture

Each provider has a pipeline in `codegen/<provider>/` with:

- `pipeline.ts` — schema fetching and model generation orchestration
- `extensionModelGenerator.ts` — TypeScript model file generation
- `libGenerator.ts` — shared library file generation

Shared code in `codegen/shared/` handles:

- `schema/` — schema loading, normalization, property splitting, and types
- `zodGenerator.ts` — CfProperty → Zod schema code generation
- `denoConfigGenerator.ts` — generated `deno.json` files
- `manifestGenerator.ts` — generated `manifest.yaml` files
- `version.ts` — CalVer versioning with content-based change detection
- `awsCredentials.ts` — canonical AWS credential utilities (IMDS skip, error
  classification, preflight check); generated into hand-written extensions via
  `generate:aws-credentials` and inlined into generated models via
  `libGenerator.ts`

Design documents explain each provider's schema-to-model mapping decisions:

- [AWS](codegen/designs/aws.md) — CloudFormation schema → CloudControl models
- [GCP](codegen/designs/gcp.md) — Cloud Asset Inventory schema → GCP models
- [Hetzner Cloud](codegen/designs/hetzner.md) — OpenAPI → Hetzner models
- [DigitalOcean](codegen/designs/digitalocean.md) — OpenAPI → DigitalOcean models

**Read the relevant design doc before modifying a provider's codegen pipeline.**

## Pull Requests

This repo is hosted on Forgejo at `git.swamp-club.com`. Use the `fgj` CLI
(not `gh`) for all PR operations:

```bash
fgj pr create -R swamp-club/swamp-extensions -B main -H <branch> -t "title" -b "body"
```

Do not use `gh` — it targets GitHub, which is not the upstream for this repo.

## Publishing

CI auto-publishes when `manifest.yaml` changes on main and the version is newer
than what's in the registry. Manual: `swamp extension push manifest.yaml` from
the extension directory.
