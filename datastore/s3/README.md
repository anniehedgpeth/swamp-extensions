# @swamp/s3-datastore

Swamp datastore backend that stores repository state in an
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket and keeps a local cache in sync
with it. Distributed locking is implemented on top of S3 conditional writes so
that multiple swamp processes can safely share the same bucket.

## Installation

```sh
swamp extension pull @swamp/s3-datastore
```

The companion workflow extension
[`@swamp/s3-datastore-bootstrap`](../../workflows/s3-bootstrap/README.md)
provisions a bucket and a least-privilege IAM managed policy in one step.

## Configuration

Credentials are resolved via the standard AWS credential chain — no credentials
in config. Provide them via one of:

- Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- AWS profile: `~/.aws/credentials`
- IAM role attached to the instance, task, or pod

The calling principal needs these S3 actions on the target bucket and objects:

- `s3:GetObject` (authorizes GetObject, HeadObject)
- `s3:PutObject`
- `s3:DeleteObject`
- `s3:ListBucket` (authorizes ListBucket, HeadBucket)

## Usage

Switch the current swamp repository over to an S3-backed datastore:

```bash
swamp datastore setup @swamp/s3-datastore \
  --config '{"bucket": "my-bucket", "prefix": "swamp", "region": "us-east-1"}' \
  --json
```

Check the active datastore and its health:

```bash
swamp datastore status
swamp datastore verify
```

## S3-compatible endpoints

The datastore speaks the S3 API, so any S3-compatible object store works. Set
`endpoint` (and `forcePathStyle: true` where required) to point at MinIO,
DigitalOcean Spaces, Cloudflare R2, or other providers.

## Sync configuration

Transfer concurrency is configurable via the `pullConcurrency` and
`pushConcurrency` config fields (defaults: 50 and 25 respectively).
Users on constrained S3-compatible endpoints can dial these back:

```bash
swamp datastore setup @swamp/s3-datastore \
  --config '{"bucket": "my-bucket", "pullConcurrency": 10, "pushConcurrency": 5}'
```

The per-request timeout defaults to 30 seconds and can be overridden via
the `requestTimeoutMs` config field (1000–600000 ms) or the
`SWAMP_S3_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable (env var takes
precedence). Increase this on slow or high-latency links to avoid
silent timeout failures on large objects:

```bash
export SWAMP_S3_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=120000
```

## Efficiency features

- **Per-path dirty tracking**: `markDirty({ relPath })` records which
  directories changed. `pushChanged` walks only those directories instead
  of the entire cache. A 200-path cap falls back to a full walk for bulk
  operations.
- **SHA-256 content hashing**: File content is hashed on push and stored in
  the index. On subsequent pushes, files with matching size and mtime skip
  I/O entirely; files with matching size but different mtime are hash-compared
  to avoid redundant uploads across machines with clock skew.
- **Shard-first index**: After migration to v2 (`swamp datastore migrate-index`),
  per-model partition shards under `_index/` are the source of truth.
  Commits write only the dirty shards and `_meta.json`, skipping the
  monolithic `.datastore-index.json` upload entirely. Pre-v2 repos
  continue dual-writing both formats.
- **Scoped sync**: The extension advertises `scopedSync` capability. When the
  framework passes `context.models`, pull and push operate only on the
  specified models.
- **Namespace-scoped sync**: When `options.namespace` is set, index operations
  are scoped to `{namespace}/.datastore-index.json` and data walks are
  restricted to the namespace subtree. Three additional methods support
  multi-repo shared datastores: `exportCatalog` writes a catalog manifest,
  `pullForeignCatalogs` fetches catalogs from other namespaces, and
  `fetchForeignContent` downloads individual files from foreign namespaces.
  Solo mode (no namespace) is fully backward compatible.
- **Namespace manifest support**: The provider implements `registerNamespace`
  and `listNamespaces` for multi-repo conflict detection. `registerNamespace`
  writes a `.namespace.json` manifest to `{namespace}/.namespace.json` in the
  bucket, with check-then-write conflict detection (a second repo with a
  different `repoId` is rejected). `listNamespaces` scans the bucket for all
  registered namespace manifests and returns the namespace slugs.

## Observability

The extension emits [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) spans for S3
operations, lock acquisition/release, and push/pull sync. Spans are no-ops
when no `TracerProvider` is configured in the host process. When swamp is
running with OTel enabled, datastore activity appears in traces with
attributes following OTel semantic conventions (bucket, key, HTTP status,
request ID).

## Backward compatibility

- Pre-v2 repos continue to write the monolithic `.datastore-index.json`
  alongside partition shards (dual-write). After v2 migration, the
  monolithic index is no longer written on push — shards are the source
  of truth. Clients that only read the monolith should migrate.
- Old clients ignore the `sha256` field in index entries (JSON forward compat).
- A v1 sidecar read by the new code triggers a full walk (safe fallback).
- The `_index/` directory is excluded from sync — old clients never see it.

## Cache-write contract

The fast-path sync optimization maintains a `.datastore-sync-state.json`
sidecar in the cache directory. Any write into the cache that does not
route through the sync service's internal path MUST be accompanied by a
call to `DatastoreSyncService.markDirty()`; otherwise the next
`pushChanged` fast-paths past the write and the upload is silently
skipped. swamp-core calls `markDirty()` from its repository layer for
this reason. Downstream tooling that writes into the cache directory
directly must follow the same contract.

The `markDirty` method now accepts an optional `relPath` parameter for
per-path tracking. When `relPath` is provided, only that directory is
walked on the next push. Without `relPath`, the entire cache is walked
(bulk invalidation).

When `markDirty({ relPath })` is called before removing a file from the
cache, the next `pushChanged` detects the absence and issues an S3
`DeleteObject` for the corresponding remote key and removes it from the
index. If per-path dirty tracking overflows (>200 paths), the bulk walk
compares the full index against local files and deletes remote-only
entries. Deletions are suppressed when lazy hydration is active to avoid
removing un-hydrated content.
