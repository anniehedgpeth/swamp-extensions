/**
 * Swamp model that runs commands against a fixed-up-front fleet of hosts

 *
 * OpenSSH targets are multiplexed via ControlMaster; Tailscale SSH targets
 * authenticate via tailnet identity and bypass multiplexing. Hosts and
 * per-host operations land as resources so workflows can branch on them.
 *
 * The model entrypoint is intentionally thin — schemas live in
 * `_lib/schemas.ts`, operation logic in `_lib/operations.ts`, and checks in
 * `_lib/checks.ts`.
