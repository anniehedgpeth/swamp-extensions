The default value is 30 days. When you remove a KMS key from a CloudFormation stack, KMS schedules the KMS key for deletion and starts the mandatory waiting period. The PendingWindowInDays property determines the length of waiting period. During the waiting period, the key state of KMS key is Pending Deletion or Pending Replica Deletion, which prevents the KMS key from being used in cryptographic operations. When the waiting period expires, KMS permanently deletes the KMS key. KMS will not delete a [multi-Region primary key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) that has replica keys. If you remove a multi-Region primary key from a CloudFormation stack, its key state changes to PendingReplicaDeletion so it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This state can persist indefinitely. When the last of its replica keys is deleted, the key state of the primary key changes to PendingDeletion and the waiting period specified by PendingWindowInDays begins. When this waiting period expires, KMS deletes the primary key. For details, see [Deleting multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html) in the *Developer Guide*. You cannot use a CloudFormation template to cancel deletion of the KMS key after you remove it from the stack, regardless of the waiting period.

For help choosing a key spec for your KMS key, see [Choosing a KMS key type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-choose.html) in the *Developer Guide*. The KeySpec property determines the type of key material in the KMS key and the algorithms that the KMS key supports. To further restrict the algorithms that can be used with the KMS key, use a condition key in its key policy or IAM policy. For more information, see [condition keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms) in the *Developer Guide*. If you change the value of the KeySpec property on an existing KMS key, the update request fails, regardless of the value of the [UpdateReplacePolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatereplacepolicy.html). This prevents you from accidentally deleting a KMS key by changing an immutable property value. [services that are integrated with](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration) use symmetric encryption KMS keys to protect your data. These services do not support encryption with asymmetric KMS keys. For help determining whether a KMS key is asymmetric, see [Identifying asymmetric KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/find-symm-asymm.html) in the *Developer Guide*. KMS supports the following key specs for KMS keys: Symmetric encryption key (default) SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT (AES-256-GCM) HMAC keys (symmetric) HMAC_224 HMAC_256 HMAC_384 HMAC_512 Asymmetric RSA key pairs (encryption and decryption *or* signing and verification) RSA_2048 RSA_3072 RSA_4096 Asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve key pairs (signing and verification *or* deriving shared secrets) ECC_NIST_P256 (secp256r1) ECC_NIST_P384 (secp384r1) ECC_NIST_P521 (secp521r1) ECC_NIST_EDWARDS25519 (ed25519) - signing and verification only *Note:* For ECC_NIST_EDWARDS25519 KMS keys, the ED25519_SHA_512 signing algorithm requires [MessageType:RAW](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Sign.html#KMS-Sign-request-MessageType), while ED25519_PH_SHA_512 requires [MessageType:DIGEST](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Sign.html#KMS-Sign-request-MessageType). These message types cannot be used interchangeably. Other asymmetric elliptic curve key pairs (signing and verification) ECC_SECG_P256K1 (secp256k1), commonly used for cryptocurrencies. Asymmetric ML-DSA key pairs (signing and verification) ML_DSA_44 ML_DSA_65 ML_DSA_87 SM2 key pairs (encryption and decryption *or* signing and verification *or* deriving shared secrets) SM2 (China Regions only)",

For a list of AWS-Regions in which multi-Region keys are supported, see [Multi-Region keys in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the **. If you change the value of the MultiRegion property on an existing KMS key, the update request fails, regardless of the value of the [UpdateReplacePolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatereplacepolicy.html). This prevents you from accidentally deleting a KMS key by changing an immutable property value. For a multi-Region key, set to this property to true. For a single-Region key, omit this property or set it to false. The default value is false. *Multi-Region keys* are an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different AWS-Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them to encrypt data in one AWS-Region and decrypt it in a different AWS-Region without making a cross-Region call or exposing the plaintext data. For more information, see [Multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the *Developer Guide*. You can create a symmetric encryption, HMAC, or asymmetric multi-Region KMS key, and you can create a multi-Region key with imported key material. However, you cannot create a multi-Region key in a custom key store. To create a replica of this primary key in a different AWS-Region, create an [AWS::KMS::ReplicaKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-kms-replicakey.html) resource in a CloudFormation stack in the replica Region.

    "Specifies the number of days in the waiting period before KMS deletes a KMS key that has been removed from a CloudFormation stack. Enter a value between 7 and 30 days. The default value is 30 days. When you remove a KMS key from a CloudFormation stack, KMS schedules the KMS key for deletion and starts the mandatory waiting period. The PendingWindowInDays property determines the length of waiting period. During the waiting period, the key state of KMS key is Pending Deletion or Pending Replica Deletion, which prevents the KMS key from being used in cryptographic operations. When the waiting period expires, KMS permanently deletes the KMS key. KMS will not delete a [multi-Region primary key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) that has replica keys. If you remove a multi-Region primary key from a CloudFormation stack, its key state changes to PendingReplicaDeletion so it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This state can persist indefinitely. When the last of its replica keys is deleted, the key state of the primary key changes to PendingDeletion and the waiting period specified by PendingWindowInDays begins. When this waiting period expires, KMS deletes the primary key. For details, see [Deleting multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html) in the *Developer Guide*. You cannot use a CloudFormation template to cancel deletion of the KMS key after you remove it from the stack, regardless of the waiting period. If you specify a KMS key in your template, even one with the same name, CloudFormation creates a new KMS key. To cancel deletion of a KMS key, use the KMS console or the [CancelKeyDeletion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CancelKeyDeletion.html) operation.
