For example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the AWS managed key in the US West (Oregon) Region, the ARN of the AWS managed key would be arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses.

To use a customer managed key that you created in AWS KMS, provide the ARN of the customer managed key and ensure that you add a statement to your key's policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more information about giving permissions, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. For more information about key policies, see the AWS KMS Developer Guide. If you do not specify an AWS KMS key, Amazon SES does not encrypt your emails. Your mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption client before the mail is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is not encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to use your AWS KMS keys for decryption.
