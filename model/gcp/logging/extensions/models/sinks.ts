/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Logging Sinks.
 *
 * Describes a sink used to export log entries to one of the following destinations: a Cloud Logging log bucket, a Cloud Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, a Pub/Sub topic, a Cloud project.A logs filter controls which log entries are exported. The sink must be created within a project, organization, billing account, or folder.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
