/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud My Business Account Management Accounts.
 *
 * An account is a container for your location. If you are the only user who manages locations for your business, you can use your personal Google Account. To share management of locations with multiple users, [create a business account] (https://support.google.com/business/answer/6085339?ref_topic=6085325).
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
