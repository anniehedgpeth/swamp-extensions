The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on `max_dispatches_per_second`. Cloud Tasks automatically sets an appropriate `max_burst_size` based on the value of `max_dispatches_per_second`. The value is dynamically optimized to ensure queue stability and throughput. It is generally at least equal to `max_dispatches_per_second` but might be higher to accommodate bursts of traffic. For queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size).

This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on `max_dispatches_per_second`. Cloud Tasks automatically sets an appropriate `max_burst_size` based on the value of `max_dispatches_per_second`. The value is dynamically optimized to ensure queue stability and throughput. It is generally at least equal to `max_dispatches_per_second` but might be higher to accommodate bursts of traffic. For queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size).
