The order of address lines should be "envelope order" for the country or region of the address. In places where this can vary (for example, Japan), `address_language` is used to make it explicit (for example, "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). In this way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a `region_code` with all remaining information placed in the `address_lines`. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved.
