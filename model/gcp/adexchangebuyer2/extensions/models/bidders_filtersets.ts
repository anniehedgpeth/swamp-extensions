/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Ad Exchange Buyer Bidders.FilterSets.
 *
 * A set of filters that is applied to a request for data. Within a filter set, an AND operation is performed across the filters represented by each field. An OR operation is performed across the filters represented by the multiple values of a repeated field, for example, "format=VIDEO AND deal_id=12 AND (seller_network_id=34 OR seller_network_id=56)".
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
