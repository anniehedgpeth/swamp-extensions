/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Agent Platform TrainingPipelines.
 *
 * The TrainingPipeline orchestrates tasks associated with training a Model. It always executes the training task, and optionally may also export data from Vertex AI's Dataset which becomes the training input, upload the Model to Vertex AI, and evaluate the Model.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
