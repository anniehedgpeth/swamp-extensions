/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Network Connectivity Spokes.
 *
 * A Network Connectivity Center spoke represents one or more network connectivity resources. When you create a spoke, you associate it with a hub. You must also identify a value for exactly one of the following fields: * linked_vpn_tunnels * linked_interconnect_attachments * linked_router_appliance_instances * linked_vpc_network
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
