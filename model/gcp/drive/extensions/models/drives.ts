 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Google Drive Drives.
 *
 * Representation of a shared drive. Some resource methods (such as `drives.update`) require a `driveId`. Use the `drives.list` method to retrieve the ID for a shared drive.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
