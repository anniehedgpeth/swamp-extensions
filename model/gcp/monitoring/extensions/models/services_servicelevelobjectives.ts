/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Monitoring Services.ServiceLevelObjectives.
 *
 * A Service-Level Objective (SLO) describes a level of desired good service. It consists of a service-level indicator (SLI), a performance goal, and a period over which the objective is to be evaluated against that goal. The SLO can use SLIs defined in a number of different manners. Typical SLOs might include "99% of requests in each rolling week have latency below 200 milliseconds" or "99.5% of requests in each calendar month return successfully."
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
