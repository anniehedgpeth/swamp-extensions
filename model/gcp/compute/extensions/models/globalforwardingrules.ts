/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine GlobalForwardingRules.
 *
 * Represents a Forwarding Rule resource. Forwarding rule resources in Google Cloud can be either regional or global in scope: * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/globalForwardingRules) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/forwardingRules) A forwarding rule and its corresponding IP address represent the frontend configuration of a Google Cloud load balancer. Forwarding rules can also reference target instances and Cloud VPN Classic gateways (targetVpnGateway). For more information, read Forwarding rule concepts and Using protocol forwarding.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
