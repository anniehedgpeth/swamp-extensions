/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine ServiceAttachments.
 *
 * Represents a ServiceAttachment resource. A service attachment represents a service that a producer has exposed. It encapsulates the load balancer which fronts the service runs and a list of NAT IP ranges that the producers uses to represent the consumers connecting to the service.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
