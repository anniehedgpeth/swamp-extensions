/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine Subnetworks.
 *
 * Represents a Subnetwork resource. A subnetwork (also known as a subnet) is a logical partition of a Virtual Private Cloud network with one primary IP range and zero or more secondary IP ranges. For more information, read Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
