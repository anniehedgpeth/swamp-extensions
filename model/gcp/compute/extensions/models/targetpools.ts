/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine TargetPools.
 *
 * Represents a Target Pool resource. Target pools are used with external passthrough Network Load Balancers. A target pool references member instances, an associated legacy HttpHealthCheck resource, and, optionally, a backup target pool. For more information, readUsing target pools.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
