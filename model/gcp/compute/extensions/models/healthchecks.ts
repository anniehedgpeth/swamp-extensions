/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine HealthChecks.
 *
 * Represents a health check resource. Google Compute Engine has two health check resources: * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionHealthChecks) * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/healthChecks) These health check resources can be used for load balancing and for autohealing VMs in a managed instance group (MIG). **Load balancing** Health check requirements vary depending on the type of load balancer. For details about the type of health check supported for each load balancer and corresponding backend type, see Health checks overview: Load balancer guide. **Autohealing in MIGs** The health checks that you use for autohealing VMs in a MIG can be either regional or global. For more information, see Set up an application health check and autohealing. For more information, seeHealth checks overview.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
