/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine RegionUrlMaps.
 *
 * Represents a URL Map resource. Compute Engine has two URL Map resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/urlMaps) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionUrlMaps) A URL map resource is a component of certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic Director: * urlMaps are used by global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal Application Load Balancers. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal Application Load Balancers, regional external Application Load Balancers and regional internal Application Load Balancers. For a list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table. This resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL,EXTERNAL_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have aloadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map Concepts.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
