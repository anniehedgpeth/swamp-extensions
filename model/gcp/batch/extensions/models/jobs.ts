Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
