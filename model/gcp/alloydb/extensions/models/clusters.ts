 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud AlloyDB Clusters.
 *
 * A cluster is a collection of regional AlloyDB resources. It can include a primary instance and one or more read pool instances. All cluster resources share a storage layer, which scales as needed.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
