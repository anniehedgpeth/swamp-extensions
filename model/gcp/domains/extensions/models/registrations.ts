/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Domains Registrations.
 *
 * The `Registration` resource facilitates managing and configuring domain name registrations. There are several ways to create a new `Registration` resource: To create a new `Registration` resource, find a suitable domain name by calling the `SearchDomains` method with a query to see available domain name options. After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to `RegisterDomain`. Another way to create a new `Registration` is to transfer an existing domain from another registrar (Deprecated: For more information, see [Cloud Domains feature deprecation](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations)). First, go to the current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain's transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to `TransferDomain`. Finally, you can create a new `Registration` by importing an existing domain managed with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) (Deprecated: For more information, see [Cloud Domains feature deprecation](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations)). First, call `RetrieveImportableDomains` to list domains to which the calling user has sufficient access. Then call `ImportDomain` on any domain names you want to use with Cloud Domains.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.

The value must be a string, a number, a boolean, or an enum value. The comparison operator should be one of =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, or : for prefix or wildcard matches. For example, to filter to a specific domain name, use an expression like `domainName="example.com"`. You can also check for the existence of a field; for example, to find domains using custom DNS settings, use an expression like `dnsSettings.customDns:*`. You can also create compound filters by combining expressions with the `AND` and `OR` operators. For example, to find domains that are suspended or have specific issues flagged, use an expression like `(state=SUSPENDED) OR (issue:*)`.',
