/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud OS Config Global.PolicyOrchestrators.
 *
 * A policy orchestrator manages project-level and zone-level policy resources, such as OS policy assignments. It provides methods to create, update, and delete these resources across projects and locations at scale. The policy orchestrator operates as a continuous loop. In each iteration, the orchestrator identifies the set of resources to be modified and progressively applies changes. If the set of resources changes over time (for example, if you add new projects), subsequent iterations address those changes. The orchestrator can either upsert or delete policy resources. For more details, see the `action` and `orchestrated_resource` fields. The policy orchestrator does not manage the lifecycle of the resources it creates. Each iteration is independent and, besides Cloud Logging, the orchestrator retains only a minimal history of past actions. Deleting the orchestrator does not affect previously created resources; these resources remain in their current state. Similarly, removing projects from the orchestrator's scope does not affect existing resources.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
