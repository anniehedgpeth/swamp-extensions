# Vercel Provider Design

## 1. Purpose

Clover's Vercel provider reads the Vercel public OpenAPI 3.0 spec and generates
a set of swamp extension models — one per API resource. Each model is a
self-contained TypeScript file that exports a `model` object with Zod schemas
and CRUD methods. A shared `_lib/vercel.ts` file provides the HTTP client,
authentication, rate-limit retry logic, and pagination helpers.

Like Cloudflare, the Vercel provider uses **per-service packaging** due to the
breadth of the API surface (~39 resource tags). Unlike Cloudflare, Vercel has no
response envelope — resources are returned directly in API responses.

**Output**: `model/vercel/{service}/` — one directory per Vercel service,
containing:

- `extensions/models/*.ts` — one file per resource
- `extensions/models/_lib/vercel.ts` — shared HTTP helpers
- `manifest.yaml` — extension package manifest

**How to run**:

```sh
deno task fetch-schema:vercel   # download the OpenAPI spec
deno task generate:vercel       # generate models from the local spec
```

---

## 2. Schema Source

The spec is fetched from Vercel's public endpoint:

```
https://openapi.vercel.sh/
```

The spec is JSON (despite no `.json` extension) and is saved to
`codegen/schemas/vercel.json` after dereferencing.

### Spec characteristics

| Metric                | Value                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| OpenAPI version       | 3.0.3                               |
| Total paths           | 264                                 |
| Total operations      | 359                                 |
| Component schemas     | 86                                  |
| Inline object schemas | ~4,709                              |
| `$ref` references     | 2,221                               |
| Tags                  | 39                                  |
| HTTP methods used     | GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD |

### $ref dereferencing

The spec uses 2,221 `$ref` references. Like the Cloudflare and DigitalOcean
pipelines, the spec is dereferenced using `@apidevtools/json-schema-ref-parser`
with cycle-safe serialization via `serializeWithCycleDetection()`.

### Inline schema dominance

The most significant structural difference from Cloudflare: only 86 schemas live
in `components/schemas`, while ~4,709 are defined inline within path operations.
The pipeline must extract properties directly from inline request/response
schemas rather than following clean `$ref` chains.

### Vendor extensions

| Extension       | Count | Use                            |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
| `x-speakeasy-*` | 24    | Speakeasy SDK generation hints |
| `x-vercel-cli`  | Some  | CLI-specific metadata          |
| `x-codeSamples` | Some  | Documentation code examples    |

These are informational and not used for codegen.

### Known spec quality issues

Community reports (vercel/community #646) document 24+ validation errors
including missing path parameter definitions, duplicate parameters, and
malformed request body schemas. The pipeline includes workarounds for specific
endpoints as needed.

---

## 3. Per-Operation Versioning

Vercel uses **per-operation versioning** — each individual endpoint has its own
version number in the path prefix. The version represents when that specific
operation was last updated, NOT alternative API versions.

### How it works

```
POST   /v13/deployments          ← create (v13)
GET    /v13/deployments/{idOrUrl} ← get (v13)
DELETE /v13/deployments/{id}      ← delete (v13)
GET    /v7/deployments            ← list (v7)
PATCH  /v12/deployments/{id}/cancel ← cancel (v12)
GET    /v3/deployments/{idOrUrl}/events ← events (v3)
GET    /v6/deployments/{id}/files ← list files (v6)
```

There is exactly ONE active path per operation. `POST /v12/deployments` does not
exist — only `POST /v13/deployments`. The spec publishes only the current
version of each operation.

### Implications for codegen

- The full path including version prefix is the canonical endpoint
- No version selection logic is needed
- Operations with different version prefixes that share a resource are grouped
  by their OpenAPI tag
- Only 6 operations are marked `deprecated: true` (old v1 checks) — these are
  skipped

---

## 4. Scoping Model

Vercel resources are scoped to a **team** via query parameters, not path
segments:

| Parameter | Type   | Description             |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| `teamId`  | string | Team ID                 |
| `slug`    | string | Team slug (alternative) |

Nearly every endpoint accepts both `teamId` and `slug` as optional query
parameters. They are mutually exclusive — providing both is an error.

### How team scoping is handled

Unlike Cloudflare's path-based scoping (`/accounts/{id}/` or `/zones/{id}/`),
Vercel's team parameters are query params appended to every request. The shared
lib injects them automatically:

```typescript
const GlobalArgsSchema = z.object({
  teamId: z.string().optional().describe("Vercel team ID"),
  slug: z.string().optional().describe("Vercel team slug"),
  // ... resource-specific fields
});
```

The lib's `request()` function merges `teamId`/`slug` into query parameters when
present.

---

## 5. Resource Discovery

### Service grouping

Resources are grouped by their OpenAPI **tag**. Vercel tags every operation
(except ~11 unversioned paths), making service assignment straightforward — no
`SERVICE_MAP` equivalent is needed.

| Tag             | Example resources                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `projects`      | Project CRUD, env vars, domains          |
| `deployments`   | Create, list, cancel, delete deployments |
| `domains`       | Domain management, verification          |
| `dns`           | DNS record CRUD                          |
| `teams`         | Team management, member invites          |
| `certs`         | SSL certificate management               |
| `edge-cache`    | Cache invalidation                       |
| `global-config` | Edge Config items, tokens, schemas       |
| `security`      | WAF/firewall, attack mode, bypass rules  |

### Path-grouping algorithm

Operations are grouped into CRUD sets by stripping the version prefix and
finding base + ID endpoint pairs:

| Base path (stripped)        | ID path (stripped)                     |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/projects`                 | `/projects/{idOrName}`                 |
| `/domains`                  | `/domains/{domain}`                    |
| `/domains/{domain}/records` | `/domains/{domain}/records/{recordId}` |

A path is the "ID variant" if its terminal segment is a `{param}`.

### Why both POST + GET are required

Same as Cloudflare: a resource must have POST (create) and GET-by-id (read) to
be codegen-eligible. Resources lacking either are skipped.

### Exclusion rules

| Tag              | Reason                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `artifacts`      | Turborepo build cache, not infrastructure   |
| `authentication` | Meta API (tokens, SSO), not manageable      |
| `billing`        | Read-only billing data                      |
| `logs`           | Streaming/read-only                         |
| `marketplace`    | Integration marketplace management          |
| `sandboxes`      | Ephemeral sandbox sessions                  |
| `user`           | User profile, not manageable infrastructure |
| `web-analytics`  | Read-only analytics data                    |

## 6. CRUD Operation Identification

### HTTP method to operation mapping

| HTTP Method | Operation         | Where                     |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| POST        | Create            | Base path                 |
| GET         | Read              | ID path (single resource) |
| PATCH       | Update            | ID path (preferred)       |
| PUT         | Update (fallback) | ID path, only if no PATCH |
| DELETE      | Delete            | ID path                   |
| GET         | List              | Base path                 |

### Schema extraction from inline definitions

Since Vercel defines most schemas inline, the pipeline extracts properties by:

1. Finding the POST request body → `content["application/json"].schema`
2. Finding the GET response →
   `responses["200"].content["application/json"].schema`
3. Flattening `allOf`/`oneOf`/`anyOf` using the same rules as Cloudflare
4. Merging create (POST) and update (PATCH/PUT) properties for GlobalArgsSchema

### Create-only property detection

Properties present in POST but absent from PATCH/PUT are flagged as
`createOnlyProperties`, same as Cloudflare.

---

## 7. Response Handling

### No response envelope

Unlike Cloudflare's `{success, errors, result}` envelope, Vercel returns
resources directly in API responses. The lib file does not need an `unwrap()`
function.

For list endpoints, Vercel uses pagination wrappers with the resource array at a
known key (varies per endpoint — e.g., `projects`, `deployments`, `records`).

### Error handling

Non-2xx responses include an `error` object:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "forbidden",
    "message": "You do not have permission to access this resource."
  }
}
```

The lib checks for non-OK status and extracts error details.

---

## 8. Identifying Field Resolution

### Mixed identifier types

Vercel uses string identifiers for most resources, but with a notable pattern:
many endpoints accept `{idOrName}` — either the resource ID or its display name.
The pipeline maps path parameters to response fields:

| Path parameter | Response field | Resources      |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `{idOrName}`   | `id`           | Projects       |
| `{id}`         | `id`           | Most resources |
| `{domain}`     | `name`         | Domains        |
| `{idOrUrl}`    | `uid`          | Deployments    |
| `{recordId}`   | `id`           | DNS records    |

### IDENTIFIER_MAP

A mapping table resolves path parameter names to response field names. The
`{idOrName}` pattern means the `get` and `delete` methods can accept either
form, but the pipeline uses the canonical ID field from responses.

---

## 9. Authentication

Vercel uses a single authentication method: **Bearer token**.

### Token resolution

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Token is resolved from:

1. `globalArgs.token` (vault-wireable, sensitive)
2. `VERCEL_TOKEN` environment variable

```typescript
const GlobalArgsSchema = z.object({
  token: z.string().optional().meta({ sensitive: true })
    .describe("Vercel API token (overrides VERCEL_TOKEN env var)"),
  // ...
});
```

No collision guard needed — `token` is unlikely to clash with resource property
names.

---

## 10. Pagination

Vercel uses cursor-based pagination with varying parameter names across
endpoints.

### Common patterns

**`until`/`since` style** (deployments, events):

```
GET /v7/deployments?until=1234567890123&limit=100
```

**`next` cursor style** (newer endpoints):

```
GET /v10/projects?next=cursor_token&limit=20
```

### Pagination detection

The pipeline detects pagination style from query parameters defined in the spec.
The `listAll()` helper supports both styles, determined per-resource at
generation time.

---

## 11. Rate Limiting

Vercel enforces rate limits. The shared lib handles 429 responses with retry
logic identical to Cloudflare:

- Respects `Retry-After` header when present
- Falls back to exponential backoff
- Maximum 3 retries
